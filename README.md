# LetsGoApplication

This application, LetsGo, was a group project for CSUSM's Software Engineering course (CS441) for the Spring 2020 semester. 


LetsGo is a social media application that was developed for this course project. It is targeted towards users age 12+
who are seeking social interaction. LetsGo provides a means for users to join or create public/private communities 
based on similar interests (interest tags), join or create public/private events, and more. It intends to be an inclusive
application that focuses on groups of users in communities and events.

The requirements specification document, architecture description document, and final report for this project will be included.
